# castanedaPInfluentialPerson

In this project we developed a website to pay hommage to someone we believe is influential. The goal was to have at least four pages and to focus either on html, css, and JS. I chose to focus on HTML and CSS first. My next step is create some JS code to add some functionality to the site. Perhaps a trivia game or be able to search through an api of all of Guru's music data.
